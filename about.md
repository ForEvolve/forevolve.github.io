I am a Web developer; my preferred technologies are C#, Asp.Net and now by far Asp.Net Core. 
I find doing HTML and CSS relaxing, from time to time, and I also like JavaScript.

I love software engineering in general, and I am more and more interested in the Microservices paradigm as well as to how to use its benefits on non-microservices (or semi-microservices) applications.

I also enjoyed my quick introduction to mobile development using Angular 2 and Ionic 2, during their beta phases, and I still have to complete my little app and transition it to non-beta, <del>before v3 lol</del> (Edit: I did fail this one).

I touched to other technologies, like PHP, TypeScript, Classic ASP, VB.NET, C++, Lua, Java, etc.

I also worked with several database engines like MS SQL Server (T-SQL), Oracle (PL-SQL), MySql and I am currently enjoying the use of NoSQL databases.

I also keep an eye open for Microsoft Azure, serverless programming, containers, Docker, Xamarin, cognitive services, etc.

I like to share knowledge and, besides blogging, I am teaching programming and web development (part time). 

In conclusion, I love technologies, and I use computers for about 30 years, so I kind of know my way around those little beasts.

My primary language is French, so if I butcher English a little, my apologies.
