I am a Web developer; my preferred technologies are C#, ASP.NET and .NET Core. 

I find doing HTML and CSS relaxing (from time to time), and I also like JavaScript. 

I also enjoyed my quick introduction to mobile development using Angular 2 and Ionic 2, during the beta phases and I still have to complete my little app and transition it to non-beta, <del>before v3 lol</del> (Edit: I did failed this one).

I have touched to a lot of other technologies, like PHP, TypeScript, Classic ASP, VB.NET, C++, Lua, Java, etc.

I also worked with several database engines like MS SQL Server (T-SQL), Oracle (PL-SQL), MySql and I am currently doing my best to learn NoSQL patterns as well.

I love software engineering, and I am, at the moment, immersed in the microservices mind-shift process!

Conclusion, I use computers for a little less than 30 years, so I kind of know my way around those little beasts.

My primary language is French, so if I butcher English a little, my apologies.

I will update this page as soon as I find the time.
