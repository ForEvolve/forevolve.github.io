After hundreds of hours of work, a new team, and two new tech reviewers, I'm delighted to announce the release of the third edition of **Architecting ASP.NET Core Applications**, a unique guide for constructing resilient ASP.NET Core web applications. 

But that was not the title of the first two editions?!? That's correct. After thoughtful consideration, the book has a new title!
Of course, I wanted to keep the essence of the first two editions, so here's the subtitle that brings that continuity: <br />**An Atypical Design Patterns Guide for .NET 8, C# 12, and Beyond**.

Have you noticed the _and Beyond_ suffix? Well, that's because the book is not only good for .NET 8 and C# 12, you'll be able to leverage its content for future versions, and we wanted to clarify this. 

Let's start with the updated Table of Content:<!--more-->

```
Section 1: Principles and Methodologies
1. Introduction
2. Automated Testing
3. Architectural Principles
4. REST APIs

Section 2: Designing with ASP.NET Core
5. Minimal API
6. Model-View-Controller
7. Strategy, Abstract Factory, and Singleton Design Patterns
8. Dependency Injection
9. Application Configuration and the Options Pattern
10. Logging patterns

Section 3: Components Patterns
11. Structural Patterns
12. Behavioral Patterns
13. Operation Result Pattern

Section 4: Application Patterns
14. Layering and Clean Architecture
15. Object Mappers, Aggregate Services, and Façade
16. Mediator and CQS Patterns
17. Vertical Slice Architecture
18. Request-EndPoint-Response (REPR)
19. Introduction to Microservices Architecture
20. Modular Monolith
```

Have you noticed? We removed the UI chapters and replaced them with more REST APIs and backend content!
Yes! This third edition is a testament to our commitment to relevancy and depth, which is now exclusively focused on developers striving for robust REST API and backend design knowledge.

## Backend Design Like You've Never Seen Before

Architecting ASP.NET Core Applications is your gateway to mastering REST API and backend designs. It gives you the know-how for building robust and maintainable apps grounded in Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns and well-known architectural principles like SOLID, DRY, and YAGNI. The book focuses on the technical architecture mindset. It is written as a journey where we improve code over time, rework and refactor examples, and more to ensure you understand the logic behind the techniques we are covering. At the end of the book, I want you to understand the choices that we made so you can apply a similar way of thinking to your real-world problems, which are not covered in any books because each challenge is unique in the real world!

This book is a deep dive into the architectural essence of building enduring ASP.NET Core applications. The third edition is here to quench your thirst for knowledge with an expanded section on Minimal APIs, more automated testing content, more architectural building blocks, more ways to organize your applications, and a closing chapter about building a modular monolith. We explore many application-building techniques, from layering to microservices.

## What's new in the third edition?

The sections are reimagined for a smoother learning journey, and the content has been revised to improve the clarity of each chapter. Chapters now prioritize REST API design and patterns, shedding extraneous UI code to concentrate on what truly matters in backend development.

Chapter 2 has been overhauled to cover testing approaches like black-box, white-box, and grey-box testing. The foundational architectural principles are rearranged, and the chapter is improved to establish the groundwork for modern application design even better than before. Two new chapters now focus on REST APIs and Minimal APIs, while a third chapter about MVC was updated.

I improved and increased the number of real-world-like examples where numerous code projects have been updated or rewritten completely. The Dependency Injection chapter benefited from significant updates as well. I split the options and logging chapter in two, and improved the content. 

Many other changes were applied, like improving the heading of chapters for easier navigation, and all chapters benefitted from content tweaks, image updates, code sample revamps, and more. On top of that, I added new content around tools like Mapperly, MassTransit, and Refit.

On top of that, Chapter 18 is a new chapter dedicated to the Request-EndPoint-Response (REPR) pattern using Minimal APIs. Chapter 19, Microservices, extends the REPR code sample to microservices architecture and API layering with a Backend For Frontend (BFF) example. Then, Chapter 20 discusses modular monolith architecture and builds on top of Chapters 18 and 19's new e-commerce examples. That last project, rebuilt in three flavors, is a larger implementation that combines more building blocks like a real app would.

## Your ASP.NET Core Development Companion

Once again, this release is crafted for intermediate ASP.NET Core developers eager to refine their knowledge of design patterns and application development. Software architects keen on revitalizing their theoretical and hands-on expertise will also find this third edition an invaluable ally. With comprehensive coverage of updated architectural patterns, RESTful design, SOLID principles, and a touch of microservices and CQRS, this edition stands as a pillar of modern backend application design.

For the best experience, I recommend you read the book cover to cover first to ensure you understand the decisions behind the refactoring and improvements we make throughout. Of course, afterward, you can use it as a reference and browse it however you please.

## Embrace The Journey of Backend Mastery

Join us on an exceptional learning path that will revolutionize your ASP.NET Core application architecture perspective. The third edition awaits you, promising a transformative encounter with REST API and backend design unlike anything you’ve experienced before.
