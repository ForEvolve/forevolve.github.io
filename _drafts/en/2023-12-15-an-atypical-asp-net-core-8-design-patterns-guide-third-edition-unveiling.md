After hunderds of hours of work, a new team and two new tech reviewers, I'm delighted to announce the release of the third edition of **Architecting ASP.NET Core Applications**, a unique guide for constructing resilient, SOLID ASP.NET Core web applications. With the tech landscape constantly shifting, this edition is a testament to our commitment to relevancy and depth, catering to developers yearning for a robust backend design experience.

But that was not the title of the first two eidtions? That's right, after thoughful consideration, the book arbor a new title this time: **Architecting ASP.NET Core Applications**!
Of course, we did not want to loose the essence of the first two editions, so here's the subtitle that brings the continuity: **An Atypical Design Patterns Guide for .NET 8, C# 12, and Beyond**.
If you have noticed the _[...] and Beyond_ suffix, well, that's because the book is not only good for .NET 8 and C# 12, you'll be able to leverage its content for future versions as well, and we wanted to make this clear.

Let's start with the updated Table of Content:

```
Section 1: Principles and Methodologies
1. Introduction
2. Automated Testing
3. Architectural Principles
4. REST APIs

Section 2: Designing with ASP.NET Core
5. Minimal API
6. Model-View-Controller
7. Strategy, Abstract Factory, and Singleton Design Patterns
8. Dependency Injection
9. Application Configuration and the Options Pattern
10. Logging patterns

Section 3: Components patterns
11. Structural Patterns
12. Behavioral Patterns
13. Operation Result Pattern

Section 4: Applications patterns
14. Layering and Clean Architecture
15. Object Mappers, Aggregate Services, and Façade
16. Mediator and CQRS Patterns
17. Vertical Slice Architecture
18. Request-EndPoint-Response (REPR)
19. Introduction to Microservices Architecture
20. Modular Monolith
```

Have you noticed? We got rid of the UI chapters and replaced them with more REST APIs, and more backend content!

## Backend Design Like You've Never Seen It Before

This book is not your average design patterns handbook. It's a deep dive into the architectural essence of building enduring ASP.NET Core applications. The third edition is meticulously updated for .NET 8, focusing on contemporary backend development. It is here to quench your thirst for knowledge with an expanded section on Minimal APIs, elaborate testing methods, an assortment of architectural building blocks, and the intriguing concept of the modular monolith.

## What's Changed? Let's Explore.

Our sections are reimagined for a smoother learning voyage, with rewritten introductions and summaries adding to the clarity of each chapter. Chapters now prioritize REST API design and patterns, shedding extraneous UI code to concentrate on what truly matters in backend development.

Chapter 2 has been overhauled to better reflect testing approaches like black-box, white-box, and grey-box. The foundational principles in Chapter 3 are rearranged to establish groundwork for modern application design effectively. Chapters 4 to 6 witness evolutionary changes with novel content on REST APIs.

We've revolutionized the approach to design patterns with simplified, real-world examples. Strategy and Abstract Factory patterns have been remodeled for clarity, employing names and structures that reflect typical industry usage. Dependency Injection and configuration management in subsequent chapters benefit from a ground-up reconstruction, offering insight into the latest .NET 8 features and practices.

## Revel in Fresh Content

We proudly introduce Chapter 18, dedicated to the Request-EndPoint-Response (REPR) pattern, unfolding its use in Minimal APIs. Chapter 19 extends the discussion to the realms of API layering with a BFF example, while the latest Chapter 20 discusses nuanced Modular Monolith architecture, paving the way for seamless, integrated backend systems.

## Your ASP.NET Core Development Companion

This release is crafted for intermediate ASP.NET Core developers who are eager to refine their application structure. Software architects and designers keen on revitalizing their expertise will find this edition an invaluable ally. With comprehensive coverage of updated architectural patterns, RESTful design, SOLID principles, and a touch on microservices and CQRS, it stands as a pillar of modern backend application design.

## Embrace The Journey of Backend Mastery

"Architecting ASP.NET Core Applications" is your gateway to mastering REST API and backend designs. It arms you with the know-how for building strong, flexible apps grounded in Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns and architectural principles updated for the landscape of .NET 8, and beyond.

Join us on an exceptional learning path that will revolutionize your perspective on ASP.NET Core application architecture. The third edition awaits you, promising a transformative encounter with backend design, unlike anything you’ve experienced before.
