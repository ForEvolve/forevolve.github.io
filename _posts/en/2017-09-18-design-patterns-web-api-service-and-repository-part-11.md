In the previous article, we completed the last piece of the Ninja API.
In this article, we will glue all of these pieces together by:

- Creating integration tests to integrate the Ninja subsystem confidently
- Connecting the Ninja API to Azure Table Storage
- Leveraging the new Asp.Net Core 2.0 default configuration<!--more-->

## Integration of the Ninja
We now have a fully unit tested Ninja sub-system but, we still need to integrate it together if we want it to work.

Let's first take a look at our original diagram:
<figure>
    <img src="//cdn.forevolve.com/blog/images/2017/controller-service-repo-ninja-with-DI.png">
    <figcaption>An HTTP request from the <code>Controller</code> to the data source, fully decoupled.</figcaption>
</figure>

We modified the `NinjaRepository` a little, adding two new dependencies:

- `INinjaMappingService` that help us map our ninja.
- `ITableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>` that handle the Azure SDK code for us.

The new diagram looks like this:

<figure>

    <figcaption>An HTTP request from the <code>Controller</code> to the data source, fully decoupled, including <code>NinjaRepository</code>'s dependencies.</figcaption>
</figure>

If we add the indirect `ForEvolve.Azure` dependencies, we end up with:

<figure>
    <img src="//cdn.forevolve.com/blog/images/2017/controller-service-repo-ninja-with-DI-3.png">
    <figcaption>An HTTP request from the <code>Controller</code> to the data source, fully decoupled, including <code>NinjaRepository</code>'s dependencies and the <code>ForEvolve.Azure</code> implementation.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Integration tests
The first thing that we will do is to plan our integration and create some integration test.

First, to have the tests run faster, we will `Mock` the `ForEvolve.Azure.Storage.Table.ITableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>`.
This is not part of our system so we can assume that it is working as expected and we do not need to test it out.
By doing this, it will also be easier to assess success or failure.

> We could have tested against a real Azure Storage table or even against the local emulator, but it would have required more setup.
>
> If I find the time, I would like to do that kind of end to end testing (and write about it) in a CI/CD pipeline using Postman/Newman against a real staging Azure Web App.

Even if we test our controller with a Mock, this does not mean that we should not make sure that an implementation of `ITableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>` is returned on our real system.

#### ITableStorageRepository
Let's start with the services that we will not use in our integration tests:

- When asking for the `ITableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>` service, the system should return a `TableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>` instance.
- To build that instance, we will also need an `ITableStorageSettings` which will be a `TableStorageSettings` instance.

The `ITableStorageSettings` is a simple class:

``` csharp
public interface ITableStorageSettings : IStorageSettings
{
    string TableName { get; set; }
}

public interface IStorageSettings
{
    CloudStorageAccount CreateCloudStorageAccount();
}
```

The `TableStorageSettings` class will add two properties, inherited from `StorageSettings`:

- `AccountName`
- `AccountKey`

> You could also use the `DevelopmentTableStorageSettings` class to test against the emulator during development.

Now that we took a little look at the `ForEvolve.Azure.Storage` namespace, let's write those tests.

In the `StartupTest+ServiceProvider` class of the `ForEvolve.Blog.Samples.NinjaApi.IntegrationTests` project, we will add those two tests, enforcing the rules that have previously been stated:

``` csharp
[Fact]
public void Should_return_TableStorageSettings()
{
    // Arrange
    var serviceProvider = Server.Host.Services;

    // Act
    var result = serviceProvider.GetService<ITableStorageSettings>();

    // Assert
    var settings = Assert.IsType<TableStorageSettings>(result);
    Assert.NotNull(settings.AccountKey);
    Assert.NotNull(settings.AccountName);
    Assert.Equal("MyTableName", settings.TableName);
}
```

As you can see, we want to make sure that `AccountKey`, `AccountName`, and `TableName` are set.

> I am testing `AccountKey` and `AccountName` only against `NotNull` because I do not want to hard code any credentials in the project.
> We will set that up later using secrets.

``` csharp
[Fact]
public void Should_return_TableStorageRepository_of_NinjaEntity()
{
    // Arrange
    var serviceProvider = Server.Host.Services;

    // Act
    var result = serviceProvider.GetService<ITableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>>();

    // Assert
    Assert.IsType<TableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>>(result);
}
```

Once again, this is a pretty simple test enforcing the expected type of the `ITableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>` service.

If we run those tests, they will fail. We will make them pass later.

#### NinjaControllerTest
Now that we made sure the `ITableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>` implementation is tested, we can jump right to the `NinjaControllerTest` class.

The test initialization, shared by all tests, does as follow:

``` csharp
public class NinjaControllerTest : BaseHttpTest
{
    protected Mock<ITableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>> TableStorageMock { get; }

    protected string ClanName1 => "Iga";
    protected string ClanName2 => "K≈çga";

    public NinjaControllerTest()
    {
        TableStorageMock = new Mock<ITableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>>();
    }

    protected override void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services
            .AddSingleton(x => TableStorageMock.Object)
            .AddSingleton<IEnumerable<Clan>>(x => new List<Clan> {
                new Clan{ Name = ClanName1 },
                new Clan{ Name = ClanName2 }
            });
    }

    // ...
}
```

In this part of the `NinjaControllerTest` class, the `Mock<ITableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>>` will play the role of the Azure Storage.
To do so, it needs to be registered in the `IServiceCollection`, overriding the default.
If we want to control the test clans (`IEnumerable<Clan>`), we also need to override that default as well. 

That said, do you remember our little refactoring about the extraction of the `EnforceNinjaExistenceAsync` method?
If you do, here is an extension method to help set it up in both `UpdateAsync` and `DeleteAsync` (making sure the validation pass):

``` csharp
public static class TableStorageMockExtensions
{
    public static NinjaEntity SetupEnforceNinjaExistenceAsync(this Mock<ITableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>> tableStorageMock, string clanName, string ninjaKey)
    {
        var entity = new NinjaEntity(); // Only need to be not null
        tableStorageMock
            .Setup(x => x.ReadOneAsync(clanName, ninjaKey))
            .ReturnsAsync(entity);
        return entity;
    }
}
```

Then these few helpers have been created along the way:

``` csharp
public class NinjaControllerTest : BaseHttpTest
{
    // ...

    protected NinjaEntity CreateEntity(string clanName)
    {
        return CreateEntities(1, clanName).First();
    }

    protected IEnumerable<NinjaEntity> CreateEntities(int amountOfNinjaToCreate, string clanName)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < amountOfNinjaToCreate; i++)
        {
            var ninja = new NinjaEntity
            {
                Level = i,
                Name = $"Ninja {i}",
                PartitionKey = clanName,
                RowKey = $"NinjaKey {i}"
            };
            yield return ninja;
        }
    }

    protected void AssertNinjaEntityEqualNinja(NinjaEntity entity, Ninja ninja)
    {
        Assert.Equal(entity.PartitionKey, ninja.Clan.Name);
        Assert.Equal(entity.RowKey, ninja.Key);
        Assert.Equal(entity.Name, ninja.Name);
        Assert.Equal(entity.Level, ninja.Level);
    }
}
```

These will help us compare `NinjaEntity` to `Ninja` as well as to create `NinjaEntity` classes.
All of our tests will be executed over HTTP against a real running instance of our Web API, so we can't just compare mocked references anymore.

Lets proceed method by method.

##### ReadAllAsync
We are validating that the ninja, returned by our Web API, ninja are the one returned by our mocked database, the `TableStorageMock` `ReadAllAsync()` method.

``` csharp
public class ReadAllAsync : NinjaControllerTest
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task Should_return_all_ninja_in_azure_table()
    {
        // Arrange
        var superClanNinja = CreateEntities(amountOfNinjaToCreate: 2, clanName: ClanName1);
        var otherClanNinja = CreateEntities(amountOfNinjaToCreate: 2, clanName: ClanName2);
        var all = superClanNinja.Union(otherClanNinja).ToArray();
        var expectedNinjaLength = 4;

        TableStorageMock
            .Setup(x => x.ReadAllAsync())
            .ReturnsAsync(all);

        // Act
        var result = await Client.GetAsync("v1/ninja");

        // Assert
        result.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        var ninja = await result.Content.ReadAsJsonObjectAsync<Ninja[]>();
        Assert.NotNull(ninja);
        Assert.Equal(expectedNinjaLength, ninja.Length);
        Assert.Collection(ninja,
            n => AssertNinjaEntityEqualNinja(all[0], n),
            n => AssertNinjaEntityEqualNinja(all[1], n),
            n => AssertNinjaEntityEqualNinja(all[2], n),
            n => AssertNinjaEntityEqualNinja(all[3], n)
        );
    }
}
```

##### ReadAllInClanAsync
We are validating that the ninja, returned by our Web API, are the one returned by our mocked database, the `TableStorageMock` `ReadPartitionAsync()` method.

> As a reminder, our ninja's partition key is the clan's name, which leads us to request the whole partition to query all ninja of a single clan.

``` csharp
public class ReadAllInClanAsync : NinjaControllerTest
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task Should_return_all_ninja_in_azure_table_partition()
    {
        // Arrange
        var expectedClanName = ClanName2;
        var expectedNinja = CreateEntities(amountOfNinjaToCreate: 2, clanName: expectedClanName).ToArray();
        var expectedNinjaLength = 2;

        TableStorageMock
            .Setup(x => x.ReadPartitionAsync(expectedClanName))
            .ReturnsAsync(expectedNinja);

        // Act
        var result = await Client.GetAsync($"v1/ninja/{expectedClanName}");

        // Assert
        result.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        var ninja = await result.Content.ReadAsJsonObjectAsync<Ninja[]>();
        Assert.NotNull(ninja);
        Assert.Equal(expectedNinjaLength, ninja.Length);
        Assert.Collection(ninja,
            n => AssertNinjaEntityEqualNinja(expectedNinja[0], n),
            n => AssertNinjaEntityEqualNinja(expectedNinja[1], n)
        );
    }
}
```

##### ReadOneAsync
We are validating that the ninja, returned by our Web API, is the one returned by our mocked database, the `TableStorageMock` `ReadOneAsync()` method.

``` csharp
public class ReadOneAsync : NinjaControllerTest
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task Should_return_one_ninja_from_azure_table()
    {
        // Arrange
        var expectedNinja = CreateEntity(ClanName1);
        var clanName = expectedNinja.PartitionKey;
        var ninjaKey = expectedNinja.RowKey;

        TableStorageMock
            .Setup(x => x.ReadOneAsync(clanName, ninjaKey))
            .ReturnsAsync(expectedNinja);

        // Act
        var result = await Client.GetAsync($"v1/ninja/{clanName}/{ninjaKey}");

        // Assert
        result.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        var ninja = await result.Content.ReadAsJsonObjectAsync<Ninja>();
        Assert.NotNull(ninja);
        AssertNinjaEntityEqualNinja(expectedNinja, ninja);
    }
}
```

##### CreateAsync
We are validating that the ninja, sent to our Web API, is the one received by our mocked database, the `TableStorageMock` `InsertOrReplaceAsync()` method.

``` csharp
public class CreateAsync : NinjaControllerTest
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task Should_create_the_ninja_in_azure_table()
    {
        // Arrange
        var ninjaToCreate = new Ninja
        {
            Name = "Bob",
            Level = 6,
            Key = "12345",
            Clan = new Clan { Name = ClanName1 }
        };
        var ninjaBody = ninjaToCreate.ToJsonHttpContent();

        var mapper = new Mappers.NinjaEntityToNinjaMapper();
        NinjaEntity createdEntity = null;
        TableStorageMock
            .Setup(x => x.InsertOrReplaceAsync(It.IsAny<NinjaEntity>()))
            .ReturnsAsync((NinjaEntity x) => {
                createdEntity = x;
                return x;
            });

        // Act
        var result = await Client.PostAsync("v1/ninja", ninjaBody);

        // Assert
        result.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        var ninja = await result.Content.ReadAsJsonObjectAsync<Ninja>();
        Assert.NotNull(ninja);
        Assert.NotNull(createdEntity);
        AssertNinjaEntityEqualNinja(createdEntity, ninja);
    }
}
```

##### UpdateAsync
We are validating that the ninja, sent to our Web API, is the one received by our mocked database, the `TableStorageMock` `InsertOrMergeAsync()` method.

``` csharp
public class UpdateAsync : NinjaControllerTest
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task Should_update_the_ninja_in_azure_table()
    {
        // Arrange
        var ninjaToUpdate = new Ninja
        {
            Clan = new Clan { Name = ClanName1 },
            Key = "Some UpdateAsync Ninja Key",
            Name = "My new name",
            Level = 1234
        };
        var ninjaBody = ninjaToUpdate.ToJsonHttpContent();

        NinjaEntity updatedEntity = null;
        TableStorageMock
            .Setup(x => x.InsertOrMergeAsync(It.IsAny<NinjaEntity>()))
            .ReturnsAsync((NinjaEntity n) =>
            {
                updatedEntity = n;
                return n;
            });
        TableStorageMock
            .SetupEnforceNinjaExistenceAsync(ClanName1, ninjaToUpdate.Key);

        // Act
        var result = await Client.PutAsync("v1/ninja", ninjaBody);

        // Assert
        result.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        var ninja = await result.Content.ReadAsJsonObjectAsync<Ninja>();
        Assert.NotNull(ninja);
        Assert.NotNull(updatedEntity);
        AssertNinjaEntityEqualNinja(updatedEntity, ninja);
    }
}
```

##### DeleteAsync
We are validating that the ninja, sent to our Web API, is the one received by our mocked database, the `TableStorageMock` `DeleteAsync()` method.

``` csharp
public class DeleteAsync : NinjaControllerTest
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task Should_delete_the_ninja_from_azure_table()
    {
        // Arrange
        var ninjaToDelete = CreateEntity(ClanName1);
        var clanName = ninjaToDelete.PartitionKey;
        var ninjaKey = ninjaToDelete.RowKey;

        TableStorageMock
            .SetupEnforceNinjaExistenceAsync(clanName, ninjaKey);
        TableStorageMock
            .Setup(x => x.DeleteOneAsync(clanName, ninjaKey))
            .ReturnsAsync(ninjaToDelete);

        // Act
        var result = await Client.DeleteAsync($"v1/ninja/{clanName}/{ninjaKey}");

        // Assert
        result.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        var ninja = await result.Content.ReadAsJsonObjectAsync<Ninja>();
        Assert.NotNull(ninja);
        AssertNinjaEntityEqualNinja(ninjaToDelete, ninja);
    }
}
```

Since we have not yet integrated our system, if we run all tests, our new integration tests will fail.

### Startup dependencies
Now that our integration tests are ready, it is time to register our dependencies with the DI Container.

I divided the dependencies into three groups:

1. Mappers
1. Ninja
1. ForEvolve.Azure

#### Mappers
In `Startup.ConfigureServices`, we will add the following:

``` csharp
services.TryAddSingleton<IMapper<Ninja, NinjaEntity>, NinjaToNinjaEntityMapper>();
services.TryAddSingleton<IMapper<NinjaEntity, Ninja>, NinjaEntityToNinjaMapper>();
services.TryAddSingleton<IMapper<IEnumerable<NinjaEntity>, IEnumerable<Ninja>>, EnumerableMapper<NinjaEntity, Ninja>>();
```

These define our mappers:

1. `Ninja` to `NinjaEntity`
1. `NinjaEntity` to `Ninja`
1. `IEnumerable<NinjaEntity>` to `IEnumerable<Ninja>`

#### Ninja
In `Startup.ConfigureServices`, we will add the following:

``` csharp
services.TryAddSingleton<INinjaService, NinjaService>();
services.TryAddSingleton<INinjaRepository, NinjaRepository>();
services.TryAddSingleton<INinjaMappingService, NinjaMappingService>();
```

These represent our core Ninja pipeline.

> I put the `INinjaMappingService` in the ninja's section since it is more of a core service than a mapper (it is a Fa√ßade to our mapping subsystem remember?).

#### ForEvolve.Azure
This section is a little less strait-forward since we need to access configurations and use secrets.
Once you know all of this, it is as easy as the previous steps; now is the time to cover all that up!

##### Configurations
By default, Asp.Net Core 2.0 do most of the configuration plumbing for us.
The only thing we will need to do is get the configurations injected in the `Startup` class by adding a constructor and a property (for future references).

> Great job on this one to the Asp.Net Core team!
>
> Asp.Net was never as clean as Asp.Net Core 1.0, and Asp.Net Core 1.0 was not close to Asp.Net Core 2.0.
> Now we are talking!

``` csharp
public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
{
    Configuration = configuration;
}

public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }
```

Once this is done, we can access our configurations, as easy as that.

##### ConfigureServices

Now that we have access to `Configuration`, in `Startup.ConfigureServices`, we will add the following:

``` csharp
services.TryAddSingleton<ITableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>, TableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>>();
services.TryAddSingleton<ITableStorageSettings>(x => new TableStorageSettings
{
    AccountKey = Configuration.GetValue<string>("AzureTable:AccountKey"),
    AccountName = Configuration.GetValue<string>("AzureTable:AccountName"),
    TableName = Configuration.GetValue<string>("AzureTable:TableName")
});
```

Most of the classes and interfaces are taken from the `ForEvolve.Azure` assembly and will help us access Azure Table Storage.

The main class is `TableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>`, associated to the `ITableStorageRepository<NinjaEntity>` interface that is injected in our `NinjaRepository`.
To create the `TableStorageRepository`, we need to provide an `ITableStorageSettings`, as talked about earlier.
The default `TableStorageSettings` implementation should do the job but, we need to set some values.
These values will come from the application configurations.

- **AccountKey:** this is one of your Azure Storage "Access Keys."
- **AccountName:** this is your Azure Storage name, the one you entered during creation.
- **TableName:** this is the name of the table to use.

<figure>
    <img src="//cdn.forevolve.com/blog/images/2017/azure-storage-access-keys.png">
    <figcaption>To access your Azure Storage <strong>Access Keys</strong> click on this menu item.</figcaption>
</figure>

###### Application settings
By default, Asp.Net Core 2 read from `appsettings.json`, `appsettings.{env.EnvironmentName}.json`, User Secrets and Environment Variables.

---

> See the source code of [WebHost.cs](https://github.com/aspnet/MetaPackages/blob/rel/2.0.0/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore/WebHost.cs#L157) for more information about the `CreateDefaultBuilder()` method which creates the default configuration options.

---

We will use the first 3 of these settings location.
If we were to deploy our application, we would also use the Environment Variables as well.

To start, in the `appsettings.json`, we will add the default settings.
They are mostly placeholders but the `TableName`.

``` json
  "AzureTable": {
    "AccountKey": "[Configure your account key in secrets]",
    "AccountName": "[Configure your account name in secrets]",
    "TableName": "Ninja"
  }
```

In the `appsettings.Development.json` we will override the `TableName` to make sure that we are not writing to the "production" table (in case it is on the same Azure Storage Account - which could be a bad idea for a real project). 

``` json
  "AzureTable": {
    "TableName": "NinjaDev"
  }
```

Finally, we will add our credentials to the User Secrets, using the secrets manager (don't worry, it is only JSON).

<figure>
    <header>Secret Manager</header>
    <blockquote>The Secret Manager tool stores sensitive data for development work outside of your project tree. The Secret Manager tool is a project tool that can be used to store secrets for a .NET Core project during development. With the Secret Manager tool, you can associate app secrets with a specific project and share them across multiple projects.</blockquote>
    <figcaption>Quoted from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets#secret-manager">Safe storage of app secrets during development in ASP.NET Core</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

To open the secrets manager, right-click the `ForEvolve.Blog.Samples.NinjaApi` project then clicks the `Manage User Secrets` menu item.

<figure>
    <img src="//cdn.forevolve.com/blog/images/2017/vs-right-click-manage-user-secrets.png">
    <figcaption>VS 2017: find the "Manage User Secrets" element in the project context menu.</figcaption>
</figure>

This should open an empty `secrets.json` file.
We will use this file to manage our credentials.

In my opinions, the biggest upside of secrets is that **it is located outside of the solution directory**.
Due to this, secrets are **not added to source control**, which gives the option of configuring **settings per developer** (connection strings, accounts, username, password, etc.). It also allow you to keep the production credentials somewhere else; developers might not even have access to production credentials.

<figure>
    <header>Warning</header>
    <blockquote>The Secret Manager tool does not encrypt the stored secrets and should not be treated as a trusted store. It is for development purposes only. The keys and values are stored in a JSON configuration file in the user profile directory.</blockquote>
    <figcaption>Quoted from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets#secret-manager">Safe storage of app secrets during development in ASP.NET Core</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

We will add our development credentials to `secrets.json`.

``` json
{
  "AzureTable": {
    "AccountKey": "some-key==",
    "AccountName": "some-account-name"
  }
}
```

---

> **Where are those secret?**
> 
> Secrets are saved in some user subdirectory, and Visual Studio knows about it using the `UserSecretsId` tag of the `csproj` file.
>
> Ex.: in the `ForEvolve.Blog.Samples.NinjaApi.csproj` file: `<UserSecretsId>aspnet-ForEvolve.Blog.Samples.NinjaApi-F62B525A-ACF4-4C7C-BF23-1EB0F434DDE5</UserSecretsId>`

##### That's it for Azure!
It takes way longer to write or read this part of the article than it takes to actually do the job.

As you can see, it is ultra easy to connect to Azure Table Storage when using the ForEvolve Framework.
You only need to define a few settings and register a few services.
There are other functionalities in the framework, but I will keep that for another day.

### That's it for the Ninja subsystem integration
At this point, if we run our automated tests, everything should be green!

We should also be able to access the ninja's data from a browser or with a tool like Postman by running the API (`F5`).

## The end of this article
Congratulation, you reached this end of the article series!

Moreover, **this end** was not a typo.
I have many ideas to build on top of the Ninja API; yes, I might write articles based on this code in the future.

### What have we covered in this article?
In this article:

- We created integration tests, over HTTP
- We integrated the Ninja subsystem
- We used `ForEvolve.Azure` to connect the Ninja App to Azure Table Storage
- We explored the new Asp.Net Core 2.0 default configuration and used 3 out of 4 of its sources.

I hope you enjoyed the little glimpse of the ForEvolve Framework, it is still a work in progress, and there are many functionalities that I would like to add to it (and probably a lot more that I have not thought of yet).

If you have any interest, question, request or time to invest: feel free to leave a comment here or open an issue in the [ForEvolve Framework GitHub](https://github.com/ForEvolve/ForEvolve-Framework) repository.

### What's next?
What's next?
You guys tell me.

- What are you up to now that you played a little around with Repositories, Services, and Web APIs?
- Any project in mind?
- Maybe a ninja game ahead?

I hope you enjoyed, feel free to leave a comment and happy coding!
