The first step is to create a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) website.

Any static website or site builder could do the job if you want to try that out after reading all the articles. I may even try to go [Blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor) on Azure in the future, who knows!<!--more-->

## The setup

### If you need to install Jekyll and Ruby

You should follow the [official Jekyll installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install all prerequisites.

    <section>
        <p>If you have Windows 10, this is the easiest way that I fugyured out to set everthing up:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the Windows Store</li>
            <li>Search and install Ubuntu.</li>
            <li>
                Then I open a bash terminal and follow the official
                <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#ubuntu">Install on Ubuntu Linux</a>
                instruction from the Jekyll website.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This is way easier than setting up everything on Windows (unless stuff changed recently and since I wrote this).
            <i>Non-Microsoft things tend to be easier to install using bash!</i>
        </p>
        <p>Another cool thing, if you are using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, you can access bach directly from there in the VS Code folder. This is really awesome, you should use this oportunity to try that out!</p>

### If you have Jekyll installed

Using Jekyll to create a website is as easy as to follow the official [Quick-start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).

Or you can try to follow these steps:

1.  Create directory (I will call mine `JekyllOnAzure`)
1.  Initialize a Git repository
1.  Open a terminal (or open the folder in VS Code then use the integrated terminal) and type `bash` to start a bash session (if your terminal is not already bash)
1.  Type `jekyll new .`
1.  Commit you changes

And voil√†! You got yourself a new empty Jekyll website.

From here, you can use another theme, add some plugins, etc. I will not cover Jekyll customization, this site is only a mean to an end; I will leave you to build your own thing!
