Today I will explain how to add your PHP runtime directory to your Windows 10 `PATH` environment variable.
This will give you global access to `php.exe` from any command prompt.

*Please note that you must reopen your command prompt windows (if you had any open prior to the update).*

*Command prompt loads the `PATH` environment variable when it is first open.*

## Target audience

* Windows 10 users
* PHP developers that want PHP to be globally accessible from any command prompt (ex.: php.exe for "linting" or to start a dev. server)

*Note that you are not limited to PHP, this can be any directory containing any program - ex.: `npm`*
