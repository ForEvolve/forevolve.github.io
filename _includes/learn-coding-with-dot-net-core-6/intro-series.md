This article is part of a **learn programming** series where you need **no prior knowledge of programming**.
If you want to **learn how to program** and want to learn it **using .NET/C#**, this is the right place.
I suggest reading the whole series in order, starting with {% include learn-coding-with-dot-net-core-6/ref.md index=0 %}, but that's not mandatory.
